This is an about page. 

Tim Buckingham built this as part of the second phase of the Perseids Project. 
The purpose of Gardner was to make something that was simple to use, but powerful enough that it could manage displaying treebanks on its own.
Hopefully, anyone, from the large researcher, to the high school class that wants to be proud of a semester's worth of work, can use  gardner, with no knowledge of web design.
With this, you should be able to host and display your own collection of treebanks. 

Si hortum in bibliotheca habes, nihil deerit.
